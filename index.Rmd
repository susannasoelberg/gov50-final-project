## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to...
Census data in Texas and how many people are undercounted (especially racial minorities and low income citizens), and how that affects state/county funding and resources in these areas. If possible, I would like to see how this is related to voting accessibility and how the new restrictive photo ID voting laws are also affecting these populations.

## Written Proposal

Does the grade assigned to an area by the Home Owner's Loan Corporation (HOLC) determine the racial demographics of that area? I plan to study how historical redlining has affected the racial makeup of cities today and how its effects are still present. The HOLC data is from maps drawn in 1935-1940. I predict that cities with lower HOLC scores in the past will have higher non-white populations and that cities with higher HOLC scores in the past will have lower non-white populations. My unit of analysis is each metro area (metro_area) (ex. Chicago). My explanatory variable is the HOLC grade (scale from A as "best" to D as "hazardous") and my outcome variable is the percentage of a population in a HOLC zone that is non-white (combination of pct_black, pct_hispanic, pct_asian, and pct_other). If I observe a higher HOLC score (A or B) in an area with a high white population or a lower HOLC score (C or D) in an area with a high non-white population, that will support my hypothesis.
